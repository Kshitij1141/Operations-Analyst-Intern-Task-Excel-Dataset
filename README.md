## 🌟 Introduction
This Operations Intern Assignment simulates real analyst workflows using Excel/Google Sheets. It focuses on data cleaning, extracting country codes, validating phone numbers against countries, and automating repetitive tasks with formulas. The goal is to deliver clean, accurate, and structured operational data.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🗂️ Clean and format raw datasets containing phone numbers with country codes.  
- ✂️ Extract key components such as country codes and numeric values.  
- ✅ Perform validation checks between phone numbers and country names.  
- 🔄 Ensure all processes are formula-driven, avoiding manual work.  
- 📈 Prepare structured, automated datasets for operations and reporting.  

---

## 📂 Dataset Context
- **Column A** → Phone numbers with `+` country codes (e.g., `+919876543210`)  
- **Column B** → Country names (e.g., `India`, `UK`, `USA`)  
- **Column C–F** → Helper columns generated by tasks (code, cleaned number, validations).

## 📝 Tasks (Step by Step)

| Step | Task                                                                                   | Expected Action                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Merge values (country code + phone number).                                             | Combine into one complete phone number.                                         |
| 2    | Extract country code into a new column (Column C).                                      | Separate numeric country code from phone numbers.                               |
| 3    | Remove the `+` sign in phone numbers (Column D).                                        | Output contains only the number without symbols.                                |
| 4    | Validate if each phone number in Column A matches an entry in Column B (Countries).     | Return `True` if present, otherwise `Not True`.                                 |
| 5    | Validate if each country name in Column B exists in Column A’s phone number dataset.    | Return `True` if match is found, otherwise `Not True`.                          |

## 📊 Example Output Format

| Column A (Phone No.) | Column B (Country) | Column C (Code) | Column D (No `+`) | Column E (A in B?) | Column F (B in A?) |

| +919876543210         | India              | 91              | 919876543210      | True               | True               |
| +441234567890         | UK                 | 44              | 441234567890      | True               | True               |
| +12025550173          | USA                | 1               | 12025550173       | Not True           | Not True           |
